    "# Ungraded Lab: TensorFlow Model Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In production systems, the decision to deploy a model usually goes beyond the global metrics (e.g. accuracy) set during training. It is also important to evaluate how your model performs in different scenarios. For instance, does your weather forecasting model perform equally well in summer compared to winter? Or does your camera-based defect detector work only in certain lighting conditions? This type of investigation helps to ensure that your model can handle different cases. More than that, it can help uncover any learned biases that can result in a negative experience for your users. For example, if you're supposed to have a gender-neutral application, you don't want your model to only work well for one while poorly for another.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will be working with [TensorFlow Model Analysis (TFMA)](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/tfma) -- a library built specifically for analyzing a model's performance across different configurations. It allows you to specify slices of your data, then it will compute and visualize how your model performs on each slice. You can also set thresholds that your model must meet before it is marked ready for deployment. These help you make better decisions regarding any improvements you may want to make to boost your model's performance and ensure fairness.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, you will use TFMA to analyze models trained on the [Census Income dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). Specifically, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* study and setup the starter files to use with TFMA\n",
    "* make a configuration file to tell TFMA what data slices it will analyze and the metrics it will compute\n",
    "* visualize TFMA's outputs in a notebook environment\n",
    "* generate a time series of a model's performance\n",
    "* compare the performance of two models so you can decide which one to push to production\n",
    "\n",
    "*Credits: Some of the code and discussions are based on the TensorFlow team's [official tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/tutorials/model_analysis/tfma_basic).*"

Typically, this is done to compare a candidate model against a baseline (such as the currently serving model) to determine what the performance differences in metrics are. When [thresholds](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/model_analysis/api_docs/python/tfma/MetricThreshold) are configured, TFMA will produce a [`tfma.ValidationResult`](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/model_analysis/api_docs/python/tfma/ValidationResult) record indicating whether the performance matches expecations.\n",

You will also validate the candidate's performance against the baseline by setting a [`tmfa.MetricThreshold`](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/model_analysis/api_docs/python/tfma/MetricThreshold) on the `BinaryAccuracy` metric. This helps in determining if your new model can indeed replace your currently deployed model."
